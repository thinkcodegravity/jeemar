Cloud server - remote machine

Remote control software : logon the remote machine, u can install, delete, create files
	putty : windows users trying to control remote Unix machine
	Terminal : mac users trying to control remote Unix machine

File Upload software : upload files from your machine to a remove machine
	winscp : Upload files from Windows laptop to Unix laptop
	Terminal : Upload files from mac laptop to Unix laptop

development : on our laptop... 
	Winscp/Terminal : to upload our website software onto aws unix machine
	Putty/Terminal : logon remote aws unix machine, run commands that can restart our website
	
	

Local machine : Laptop that is used for programming/development
Internet facing machine (production machine): AWS machine... upload website s/w ... website will be live on internet.

Software development : 2-4 weeks

	Development : programming on Eclipse/spring tool suite
	Testing : local/development testing
		start website locally on STS/Eclipse.. by clicking green play button.
		webpage programs
			browser : localhost and test your code changes
		controller programs : any Java program changes
			junit testing
	Build : it will package the entire website project files into single executable file (WAR... Web ARchive)
	Deploy : uploading website programs onto internet facing machine (AWS remote machine)
	launch/release  : restart your website...
		shutdown website that was running older website programs
		start website with latest website programs that was uploaded in deploy steps
	Testing : production testing
		changes we tested in local machine... test it with your internet facing machine

************* JDBC ************
Workbench -
	1) DB connection configuration
	choose DB - "use training"
	2) prepare query - ( prepared statement with ? )
		select * from users where userid=?
	3) set input to query (Dynamic binding)
		select * from users where userid='jane';
	4) execute query
		click lightneing symbol
		insert = executeUpdate... output is int
		update = executeUpdate... output is int
		delete = executeUpdate... output is int

*********** webservice ***************

WSDL : Web Service Description Language 
	neutral/language independant
	explaination of your webservice
	written in XML
	
	1) endpoint /URL of the webservice : Port/Address in wsdl
	2) methods/services in this webservice url : operations in wsdl
	3) input required : schema ... complex, sequences. input in wsdl
	4) output expected
	
	
Soap implementation class : webservice provider program
	program that has the logic/code of webservice.
	@webservice
	
Soap stub class : webservice consumer program

input/output : primitive data type or string (choose RPC)
input/output : complex data type arraylist, Student (choose Document)


RPC ; cannot be validated( does not include schema in wsdl file)
Document ; can be validated (include schema in wsdl file)

Schema in wsdl file are responsible for VALIDATIONS
	
	
Document
	literal : schema includes only input/output data type
	literal wrapped : schema includes input/output data type AND OPERATION name
	
	Soap document : literal wrapped
	public class calculator
		public int add(int a, int b)
		public int sub(int a, int b)
	
	Soap document : literal 
	public class calculator
		public int add(int a, int b)
		public int add(int a, int b,int c)
	
	
1) simple program
2) write @webservice on top of the program
3) input/output  - complex data as in arraylist, student ( style =Document)
	input/output  - simple data as in primitive-int/boolean , string ( style =RPC)
4) validation needed : Document
5) if webservice program has overloaded method - Document Literal
	if webservice program has multiple method with same signature - Document LiteralWrapped

Http Server Program : Servlets , Soap Webservice, Rest Web service, Struts Action 
	Server program are typically mapped to a URL
	Servlets  - @WebServlet("/login")
	Soap WebService - Endpoint.publish maps http url
	Rest Webservice - 
		every method in the program is mapped to a http url
		@RequestMapping

@WebServlet - Server program of type Servlet
@WebService - Server program of type Soap Webservice
@RestController - Server program of type Rest Webservice

	
Soap UI - Http Client : Used for testing Soap webserive , Rest webservice for Get/Post methods
Postman - Http Client : Used for testing Soap/Rest webservice for all http methods (Get/post/put etc)
Browser - Http Client : Used for testing HTML/Rest - Get webservice.
RestTemplate - Http Client : Java http client program that can consume Rest webservice (get and post)

Rest Webservice :

	Input to this webservice can be
		Http GET : 
			Path param : http://ip:port/servicename/10/20
			Request param : http://ip:port/servicename?input1=10&input2=20
		
		Http POST : 
			JSON input :
	Output from this webservice can be
		JSON, text, xml etc
		
		

Rest Get method implementation

@RestController
public class calculator{
	
	//	http://ip:port/servicename/10/20
	// servicename=addCal
	// 
	@RequestMapping(value = "/addCal/{param1}/{param2}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
	public int add(
		@PathVariable(name="param1") int a,
		@PathVariable(name="param2") int b) throws Exception {
		return a+b;
	}
	
	// http://ip:port/servicename?param1=10&param2=50
	@RequestMapping(value = "/subCal", method = RequestMethod.GET)
	public int sub(@RequestParam("param1")  int a,@RequestParam("param2")  int b) throws Exception {
		return a-b;
	}
	
	
}

HOW DO YOU WRITE REST WEBSERVICE THAT CAN RECEIVE INPUT AS JSON STRING

1) provide a url service name for the method = @RequestMapping(value = "/jsonReqMul"
2) Create Rest webmethod with post (method = RequestMethod.POST)
3) declare that it consumes JSON ( consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
4) input to this method will be received in body (@RequestBody  in the parameter)
5) Create Java program that is JSON input compliant ( parameter to your method)
	{
		"a":10,
		"b":20
	}

	public class abcd{
		int a;
		int b;
		// get set methods for above variables
	
	}

HOW DO YOU WRITE REST WEBSERVICE THAT CAN RETURN OUTPUT AS JSON STRING

1) provide a url service name for the method = @RequestMapping(value = "/jsonReqMul"
2) Use any suitable input (get or post)
3) declare that it return JSON ( produce = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
4) Create Java program that is JSON Ouput compliant ( parameter to your method)
	{
		"a":10,
		"b":20
	}

	public class abcd{
		int a;
		int b;

********************* struts framework ****************************************

Strut : MVC architecture

	Struts configuration
	1) add strut dependancy in pom.xml
	2) configure strut prepare and execute filter in the main application java
	3) src/main/resources = create file called struts.xml
	
Struts framework
	struts.xml - Controller
	action java programs - model program
	
setup struts in the project
	1) pom.xml - include all struts dependancy
	2) include struts.xml in src/main/resources
	3) include struts filter configuration method in the 
		main program ( java file ending with name Application)

View		    > controller  > Model
teststrut.html > struts.xml > action program

Servlet responsibilities :
	1) URL mapping : @Webservlet
	2) Request processing : request.getParameter
	3) business logic handling 
	4) Response generation : 
		webpage
			redirect "res.sendRedirect", 
			forward "req dispatcher fwd",
		text "res.getWriter", 
		binary "res.getoutputstream"


Servlet to strut upgrade:
	1) URL mapping : in struts.xml create action element
		map url to a class and method
		<action name="test1"  class="com.strut.ProfileAction" method="testing2">
		http://localhost/test1 - send request to ProfileAction program and testing2 method
	2) Request processing
		if html has textbox named abc
		in action program create String variable abc... get/set methods
	3) business logic handling 
		written inside chosen action program method
	4) Response generation
		based upon action method string resopnse... configure appropriate response
		in struts.xml
		
Struts.xml
	URL mapping : http url is linked to Struts program and its method
	Response : based upon string response from strut program method, u can
		return redirect html or forward html or text or json etc
		
Strut Action progam
	Form Bean - bean is program global variable and correspinding get/set methods.
		Request input gathering : HTML page customers input is gathered in this programs
		form bean section.
	Action method
		Business logic written here.
		
		
Servlet responsibilities :
	1) HTTP URL mapping : @Webservlet
	2) Request processing : request.getParameter
		collecting customer typed value
	3) business logic handling 
		code 
	4) Response generation : 
		webpage
			redirect "res.sendRedirect", 
			forward "req dispatcher fwd",
		text "res.getWriter", 
		binary "res.getoutputstream"

Strut Framework : ENFORCES MVC architecture
	Model - business logic	  (JAVA)
	View - webpage		  (HTML)
	Controller - Control http url (XML)
De-coupled architecture

	View = login webpage			(HTML)
	model+controller = servlet program	(JAVA)

		
java bean program = simple java program with variables and get/set method for those
				variable
	
	
View		    > controller  > Model (confidential/propritray)
teststrut.html > struts.xml > action program

teststrut.html > struts.xml > strut interceptor X action program
	interceptor - logging, security, performance
	
	Jsp - Java server pages
		HTML + Java
		
	Html - static webpage
	JSP - dynamic webpage
	
		
Strut tag libraries
	Input flow : webpage (submit) > Strut.xml > Action program bean variables
	Output flow : Action program bean variables > Strut.xml > webpage (STRUT TAG LIBRARY)
	Types : 
		control
		data
		ui

	web server software = tomcat
Spring framework
	architectural like struts, log, db
	
Framework = proven solution for a known category of problem
	
framework of frameworks

IOC or DI : Inversion Of Control, Dependancy Injection
	HAS-A attribute ( Global variable in a class)
@Scope("session")
public class Car{
		@Autowired
		String cart;
		@Autowired  // DI or IOC
		Engine e;
		@Autowired
		ISeat s;
		@Autowired
		ICar ic;
	}
	Car HAS-A Engine
	Car is DEPENDED on Engine
	DI = Initializing Dependancy in program

Searching compatible Complete class Object
Passing initialization paramters to the construtor
Managing life cycle of the object

	abstract
Public interface ICar{
	public void drive();
}
public class Nissan implement ICar{

AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming







public class Car{
	// loose coupled
	// tightly coupled
	// spring framework will initialize this oject.. DEPENDANCY INJECTION
	Engine engine;
	
	public void drive(){
		engine.on();
	}
}

Engine > economyEngine > superTurboEngine
Engine engine=new Engine();
Engine engine=new economyEngine ();
Engine engine=new superTurboEngine();

Car is depended on Engine
Dependancy are global variable in the program
HAS-A attributes - dependancy

Dependancy injection ? 
	creating/initializing object of global variables
	additional features (additional codes) to your class
		JDBC code
		webservices code

********* Spring data *************


Database : 
	stores information : ENTITY represents the information/record
	CRUD operations : REPOSITORY implements/provides CRUD operation
		
CRUD
Create - insert - Repository . save()
Read - select - Repository findBy........
Update - update - Repository.save()
Delete - delete - Repository.delete()

queries
	SQL
	JPQL


Part of Repository program			
	findBy	Read record	
	save	Create and Update record	
	delete	Delete record	


Read record
	Prof p=repo.findById("john");		
	sysout ( p.password );		

delete record
	Prof p=new Prof();	
	p.uid="tony";	
	repo.delete(  p );	

update record
	Prof p=new Prof();	
	p.uid="tony";	
	p.pwd="tony456";

	p.pwd="tony456";	
	p.email="tony123@g.com";	
	p.addr="oh";	
	repo.save(  p );	


Configuration SPring data

1) add dependancy spring data jpa
2) application.properties file configure Database settings
	spring.datasource
3) add location of entity and repository program in MainApplication.java program
	@EnableJpaRepositories("package.name.where.you.keep.repository.programs")

	2) Customer data has to be transferred to Server program
		
form-submit solution
	1) <form action="/authentication"> in html code (FRONT END)
	     @WebServlet("/authentication")  in java code (BACK END) 
	2) 
	server program is located at below http url
	http://localhost/authentication?userid=java&pwd=jee
	? = seperate java program link AND customer typed value
	& = seperate multiple customer typed value
	key-value pair = what customer data 
		where does the key comes from ???? userid ... pwd
		"name" attribute from input element

	authenticationjavajee = tag to server program , cust typed userid, cust typed pwd

ON CLICK OF SUBMIT BUTTON - browser generated below url 
http://localhost/authentication?userid=java&password=jee

authentication = came from "form action" attribute
userid = came from "name" attribute of first text box
java = customer typed in first text box
password = came from "name" attribute of second text box
jee =  customer typed in second text box

form-submit - connection between frontend and backend and then data transfer... 
	voluntary	=	customer has to choose to click on button voluntarily			
	synchronous =		customer has to wait until server program responds			
	Code written in = HTML
	
********************* AJAX **********

AJAX - connection between frontend and backend and then data transfer... 
	involuntary	=	customer does NOT have to do anything
	asynchronous =	customer can continue using the website
	Code written in = Javascript

recorded as XHR = Xml Http Request



name = server side java program
	1) Customer browser (html/frontend) has to connect to Server program
	2) Customer data has to be transferred to Server program
		
Ajax solution
	1) transfer control from html to javascript
		$("#userid").blur( checkUserAjax );
		(HTML ELEMENT).event_listner( JAVA_SCIPT_FUNC)
	2) 
	
	
	
get: insecure data transfer... data is visible in the url

REST********
http://localhost/addCal/10/25
int a=10;
int b=25




Rest webservice
	Get
		path input
			Ex : http://localhost/addCal/10/25

		query input = tag each information
			Ex : http://localhost/dataOfBirth?date=10&month=05
	
	Post
		JSON
	
Soap webservice
	
	
If Java program wants to read JSON data


{
	"name":"john",
	"age":12,
	"city":"ny"
}

public class Person{
	String name;
	int age;
	String city;
	// get/ set methods
}
	
	
	
Simple interest caluclator
Input to your webservice is JSON
{
	"principal":100000,
	"time":30,
	"rate":5,
}	

Java program that is JSON input compliant
public class SimpleInterestInput{
	int principal;
	int time;
	int rate;
	//get and set methods
}

get method = input is in url
?userid=john&password=john1!

post method = input is in body



HOW DO WE TEST WEBSERVICE
	GET - browser
	POST - POSTMAN
	
	
	
	
Rest as the webservice framwork
JSON as the data format framework

Microservice - Rest Over JSON


Complex JSON 2 Java conversion  example
{
	"customer":
		{
			"name":"john",
			"age":12
		},
	"address":{
		"city":"ny",
		"zip":12345
	}
}	
public class EntireInput{
	CustomerInput customer;
	AddressInput address;
	// get set method
}
public class CustomerInput{
	String Name;
	int age;
	// get set methods
}

public class AddressInput{
	String city;
	int zip;
	// get set methods
}

create webservice that take a number(simple input)
output is 
	square of the number
	cube of the number
	area of circle

input 5
output JSON (producing complex output)
{
	"square":25
	"cube":125,
	"areOfCircle":78.123
}

public class JSONNumberOutput{
	int square;
	int cube;
	float areaOfCircle;
	// get set methods
	
}

Popular Microservice implementation
	Rest webservice that CONSUME/takes input as  JSON
	Rest webservice that PRODUCES/returns output as  JSON




	public int areaOfRect( int length, int breadth) {
		int area= length * breadth;
		return area;
	}


Soap : Dotnet, Java, php

WSDL : webservice Description language
wisdal
	is an xml file
	this file describes about your webservice 
	( IN PLATFORM NEUTRAL DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE)
		What is the webservice URL
		what are the features/operations in the webservice
		what is the input and output from each operation


How to create soap webservice
	top-down approach - Expert programmer (Spring webservice)
		1) Manually create wsdl file
		2) generate java program from wsdl file
	bottom-up approach - Apache CXF framework
		annotation based soap webservice development
		1) create java program 
		2) link the program to a http url
			endpoint configuration
		3) wsdl file is automatically created from java program


wsdl file can contain XSD link

XSD = Xml Schema Definiation
	Purpose of this file is validation
	VALIDATE if customer sent mandatory inputs or not
	
	
Application.properties = configure rest webservice port
Endpoint.publish= configure soap webservice port


80 is default http port
	dont have to mention in the url
	
	
	schema used for validation
	
	RPC

********************* STRUT ***********************

MVC : decoupled architecture

Car : decoupled
	Steering >>> Engine >>>> wheel
	REPAIR-FIX issue : flat tire

	Steering >>> Engine >>>> sports wheel
	UPGRADE
	
	
STRUTS - MVC framework : reduce your work
framework : this is a pre-defined working prototype
Ikea furntiure :
	dinning table set : framework how to build a table
		all parts... instructions... 
		
		
Configuration
	1) xxxAplication.java - include strutsPreapreAndExecute Filter bean
	2) pom.xml - include struts dependancy
	3) create struts.xml in src/main/resource folder
	
	
	
	
design login webpage that allows customer with userid java and password jee
	if customer enters wrong userid/pwd = show failure.html
	if customer enters correct userid/pwd = show success.html
	
View layer program : customer can see these programs on browser
	login.html
	success.html
	failure.html

Model layer program : business logic of the company
	this is the java program that compares what customer typed with
	userid java and password jee
	
Controller layer program : Connects View with Model
	this is the struts.xml configuration
	
	
	
How did the customer input on webpage
get transferreed into model java program
1) customer type john/john1!
2) upon click of submit button control
goes to struts.xml..
browser send action name login11 to struts.xml
3) struts.xml will look... which prgram is responsible
for login11 (com.strut.Login)
4) strut framework will transfer all the data
from customers text box into similar looking
variable in java program
5) struts.xml knows which method can actually
compare userid and password


1) FROM View TO Controller
	form action="VALUE" in html 
	should MATCH
	<action name="VALUE" in struts.xml
2) FROM Controller TO Model 
	<action class="com.strut.Login"
	Model program name should be fully qualified name
	package name . class name
	method="xyz" should MATCH method name in model program
3) FROM View to Model data transfer
	<input name="userid" in html
	should MATCH
	String userid; in java program
	along with get/set method
4) MODEL program methods rules
	no parameter
	return type always String	
5) FROM Model TO Controller
	Model program returned value should match result attribute in xml
	return "good"; // model program
	<result name="good">success.html</result>
	
	
Action program :
	Form bean 
		bean : java variable with get/set method
		form : reference to html code
	Business method
		business logic written in method
		
		
Servlet response = Strut Response
	webpage
		forward : if target webpage is inside our project ( default )
		redirect : if target webpage is outside our project
	non-webpage response
		text
		binary
			set text/binary response in inputStream variable in java program
			in struts.xml result type="stream"
		json
			result type="json"
			strut framework looks for all get methods in model java program
			these variable are sent back along with values in json response
		
		
Framework project setup		
	1) create project as shown in jee class begining
	2) copy all dependencies from trainer fraemwork project into your new framework project
	3) go to src/main/resources/application.properties
		configure the database details ( refere trainer project application.properties)
	

webpages
	static : content remains same ex:wikipidea
		html webpage
	dynamic : gmail, facebook
		jsp webpage, asp
		
		jsp : HTML + Java = 
			HTML + JSP Tags = jsp tag is html style of programming
			
			Java - dynamic content
				variable = that can hold different value/DATA
				control flow = if - else, for , while
			struts tag - dynamic content
				struts tag Data element
				struts tag Control element

*******SPRING ******** Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming******

Spring framework  : programming
	architecural design
	
Spring boot : environment setup
	Out of the box solution to start web programming
	Project setup
	
to setup a Website project
1) where are all the programs stored
	java = src/main/java
	class = bin/main/java/
	html = src/main/webapp
	settings = src/main/resources
2) website software need additional software installed 
	dependancy
3) packaging = additional software like maven/ant
	post programming .. create installer/setup file .war
4) webserver software = tomcat embedded webserver

Frameworks :
	View :
		HTML , JSP, Struts tag, 
	
	Controller :
		Servlet, Rest webservice, Soap webservice, Strut Action, Spring mvc
	
	Model
		Java, Spring, 
		JDBC, hibernate, spring data
		
	Logging

	has-a steering
	
	
public class Car{
	@autowired
	Engine v8;
	@autowired
	Wheel michelin;
	Steering st;
}

Car is depended on Engine

layman terms
	dependancy : A system is dependant on other component
	dependancy injection : how the dependancy (wheel) are created for the car?

technical terms
	dependancy : global variable in a program
		Engine v8;
	dependancy injection : creating/initializing object (global variables)
		=new  Engine();
	

	
	
Interface ICar{
	public void drive();
}

public class Nissan implements ICar{
	public void drive(){
		sysout("driving nissan");
	}
	
}

ICar ic=new ICar(); // ICar is interface/abstrct/incomplete program.... new on incomplete/astract program not allowed
ICar ic=new Nissan(); 

@Autowired
ICar ic;



@autowired = dependancy injection required for below object creation challenges
	responsbiliity of initializing the global variables is upto Spring framework
	1) Engine is very complex system... how u create is not simple ( complex constructor input ******)
	
	2) interface/abstract programs not easy to initialize.. need to find out concrete implementing programs

		
		
		
IOC : inversion of control is concept 
	that is implemented with Dependancy injection
AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming
	Separte Cross cutting concerns code from real business logic code

CROSS CUTTING CONCERNS : additional lines of code that does not directly contribute to the purpose of the program
however it is still needed for successfull website/software launch

	}
	catch(Exception e){
		sysout("please try agin later. we are experincing technical difficulty");
	}

	
}



xml = configuration
annotation = configuration

1) configure spring dependancy in pom.xml
2) in main program include springbootapplication and component scan annotation
	Note package names of any class that has below @
	mention these package names in component scan
	
	
Spring annotation : below annotation mark program as Spring Program
1) package name of below programs should be mentioned in the ComponentScan
2) while using one of the spring programs NEVER create object yourself... instead use @Autowired
	@configuration : object creation , configured bean
	@component
		@controller =  java program are LINKED to a http url
			@RestController
				Associate HTTP url to a program
				converting json String to java object
				extracting all the input from http url
				construtcing http response to the customerfrom your java object
				
		@service
			Session management
			request management
			singleton 
		@repository
			Database connection
			creating queries
			setting dynamic binding
			reading results from your query
			
	@aspect
	
	Engine e=new Engine();
	
	Scope
		Singelton : 1 object of this program is created.. this will be shared by entire
				company customer
		Session : 1 Object per customer login session
		Request : 1 Object per customer request
		prototype : 1 Object per call
		

Dependancy injection
	1) If your program is depended on SPring program (@componet/service/repo/config/aspect)
	2) Create and declare global vriable to the spring program 
	3) annotate this variable with @autowired
	4) NEVER INITIALIZE THESE SPRING OBJECT

If Using findBy
1) create select sql query to search by first name
	select * from users where first_name='john'
2) execute the query
3) result is stored in entity objects
	1st entity object = andy, xyz,johnm ny null
	2nd entity object = mon xyz john boston null
	3rd entity object = john123 xyz john chicao null
4) add all 3 entity object in store in a collection list


Custom query provided in repository
1) take your query
2) dynamic binding = replacing question marks with input you pass
3) execute new query
4) results from query is stored in list / collection of entity object
5) return list result




SQL query = query is written with reference to database table and column names
	@Query(value="select * from users where first_name =?1 or last_name=?2", nativeQuery=true)
	public List<UsersEntity> searchByNativeQuery(String a,String b);

JPQL = query is written with reference to entity class and variable names	
	@Query("select u from UserEntity u where u.fName=?1 or u.lName=?2")
	public List<UsersEntity> searchByJPQLQuery(String a,String b);


Development


	Unit Testing : test individual application layer/programs/methods
	System Testing : End to End testing.... Entire project as a whole is tested
	Integration Testing : Project communicating with programs in other project/system/company/business
	Pre-production Testing : pre-production is a testing setup... replica of production setup.
	Production Testing: post internet-launch... do the testing.
