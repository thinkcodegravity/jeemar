internet - network of device (global) billions
	wireless - internet cell phone ( Roaming network )
		phone - cell tower - satalites - cell tower - phone
	wireline - home internet (Fixed network) (wifi - short range wireless - router/modem)
		(fiber , copper )
intranet - closed network , corporate, educational, organization ( 1000 or millions)
LAN - home network

ip - identify a specific device out of BILLIONs of devices connected to internet
	IPv4 = IP version 4
	X.X.X.X = 256 x 256 x 256 x 256 = 4 billion unique numbers
	X = 0-255 ( 256 possibility)
	12.	34.	215.	189
	0.0.0.0
	255.255.255.255

WAN IP : ip assigned to device that are directly connected to internet
LAN IP : ip assigned to device that are connected to internet service device such as ROUTER

domain name = alias to ip address just like contact name vs phone number

Phone num = Contact person name
123123123 = Dad
123435435 = Mom
345345439 = jane
123564654 = andy

IP address   = domain name
123.123.1.3 = www.google.com
12.56.12.123 = www.facebook.com

https://www.google.com
www.google.com =123.123.1.3
https = 443 ( encrypted data )
http = 80 ( plain data )

http://localhost

port/socket 
dns  = domain name server . maintains mapping between
	domain name and ip address

dhcp  - dynamic host configuration protocol
	assign unique ip address

router - route traffic
load balancer 

n/w commands
	ipconfig - show my lan ip address
	netstat -a - show all ports open
	ping - remote machine is reachable and response time (round trip time)
	telnet - website software is open on remote aws machine
	tracert - find delay in the network (trace route)
		multiple hops

Hyper Text Transfer protocol

fttp://www.google.com/
smtp://www.google.com/
http://www.google.com/
https://123.11.22.33:443/

port is derived by protocol
https = 443 port reserved

www.google.com - contact lisst
				name - phone number

internet contact list



https://www.facebook.com/

port :// ipaddress
21221 1232:1111:1232:1111:1232:1111:1232:1111


network commands

	ipconfig : what is ip of your machine
	netstat -a : network statistics
		my laptop 12344      www.google.com 443
	ping : if remote machine is reachable and time taken to travel btw your machine and remote m/c
		hello command
	telnet : if remote machine is readable
	tracert : find the delay in the journey.. traffic jam/ block between your m/c and remote m/c


WebServer S/w : programs that will enable a web interaction



Event listeners :
	keyboard : types
	mouse : click, mouse movement
	document : webpage ( open , close, resize


variable
function/method
object data type
operators
control flow
exception handling

************** HTML / CSS/ Javascript / Java integration *******************

Html element attributes 
	class : integrate with CSS program
		Css program provides layout , styling, color settings for html web page
	id : integrate with Javascript program
		Javascript program does pre-validation. validate if the user has entered
		proper information on the webpage before final processing.
		
		document.getElementById("userid").value
	name : integrate with Java program
		Java program does final processing.. to check if login credentials are correct,
		registration, check out is processed etc.
		
		
************** HTML - Javascript / Java transfer control *******************

	Event listeners : transfer control from html to javascript 
		Keyboard : type
			onkeypress
			onkeyup
			onkeydown
		mouse : move mouse or click
			onclick
			onmouseover
			onmouseout
		document(html) : activate a section of html, change values, webpage open/close
			onfocus : activate html element by clicking on it
			onblur : upon losing focus from html element
			onchange
	submit button click / ajax : transfer control from html to java
	
***************** Jquery ***********************

upgrade / advanced version of javascript

javascript - tightly coupled
		html program is depended on javascript
			needs to know , what event to be tracked
			needs to know, what function to be called

		animation 
		
		accessing element not easy


javascript - jquery,angular, bootstrap frameowrk
java - collection framework

Settings :
	1) html code include import jquery script 
	2) prepare document.ready function to track all events from javascript




<div id="parent">
	<div id="child"> abcd
		<input type="text" id="uid"></input>
	</div>
</div>
 
$("#uid").parent().parent()

Overloaded

	Read information if no input passed in below methods
		$("#child").html() : will return html code inside child div

		$("#child").text() : will return non-html only text inside child div
			abcd

		$("#uid").val() : will return Customer typed value on webpage
			
			
	Write information into below methods
		$("#child").html("<div></div>") : 
		$("#child").text("xyz") : 
		$("#uid").val("please enter") : 
			





************ on click of button **************

1) gather txxt box name and pair it with customer typed value
	uid=john
2) if multiple text box in same page.. they are separeted by &
	uid=john&pwd=john123


if name attribute is missing... customer entered info on webpage 
CANNOT be transferred to java program for processing




info is transferred from customer's home/browser  to your website machine
as key-value pair


sometime information transferred can be complex
